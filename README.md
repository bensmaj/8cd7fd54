## Submission For Frontend Role by Ben Smajlovic

I appreciate the opportunity to submit this assignment for Speer Technologies. This was a fun project that allowed me to stay sharp with my programming.

For this project, I utilized TailwindCSS for styling, as it's my preferred CSS styling tool. I also used the following packages:

- **React Router:** Routing
- **Lucide Icons:** Icons
- **React Hot Toast:** Toaster notifications.

### Looking forward to hearing back!
